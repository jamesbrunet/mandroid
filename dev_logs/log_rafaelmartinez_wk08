My work this week included:

- Planning of look and behavior of a simple enemy from which multiple enemy types can be created to match the style of gameplay
- Creation of a in-game mesh model for a basic enemy sentry
- Creation of a search light model for the sentry to use as a cone of vision
- Creation of a material and mesh that is used to display to the player where a planet's gravitational field starts pulling
- Started work on the layout for the enemy sentry behavior in a way that can be overriden by various anemy subcasses
