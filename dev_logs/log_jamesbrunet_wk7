We got a boatload of work done this week. What I did:
- Implemented a high score submission view, and POSTing to the server
- Got menus working, and got them looking pretty good
- Got the high score server running on the actual internet as opposed to localhost
- Augmented the existing high scores view by allowing the user to return to menu
- Many other misc changes
